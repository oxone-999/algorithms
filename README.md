Repository of algorithms, problems and structures that i have learned to help me and the others if needed.
Any suggestion of algorithm, problem or structure, just open a issue in the repository with the question label.

The majority of problems are taken from coaching code websites like LeetCode, Interviewbit, URI, Codeforces.
I suggest you guys to try their platform so you can always get new problems and articles about algorithms.

## Run C++

All the C++ code were done using the C++14 version. To compile use the following command:

```bash
g++ -std=c++14 <INPUT_FILE_NAME> <OUTPUT_FILE_NAME>
```

And to run the code:

```bash
./<OUTPUT_FILE_NAME>
```

## Run Kotlin++

To compile use the following command:

```bash
kotlinc <INPUT_FILE_NAME> -include-runtime -d <OUTPUT_FILE_NAME>.jar
```

And to run the code:

```bash
java -jar <OUTPUT_FILE_NAME>
```
