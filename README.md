The documentation for this project can be found at: <https://walterjgsp.github.io/Algorithms/>

Repository for algorithms, problems and data structures that we have used. This serves as a reference for everyone interested.
For any suggestion on algorithm, problem or data structure, just open an issue with question label.

This repo contains questions from LeetCode (most of them), Interviewbit, URI and Codeforces.
We suggest you to try their platform so you can get new problems and articles about algorithms.

## Run C++

All the C++ code were done using the C++14 version. To compile use the following command:

```bash
g++ -std=c++14 <INPUT_FILE_NAME> -o <OUTPUT_FILE_NAME>
```

And to run the code:

```bash
./<OUTPUT_FILE_NAME>
```

## Run Kotlin

To compile use the following command:

```bash
kotlinc <INPUT_FILE_NAME> -include-runtime -d <OUTPUT_FILE_NAME>.jar
```

And to run the code:

```bash
